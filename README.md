I DO NOT STORE ANY DATA OR MESSAGES.  PERIOD.

I physically can’t.  I have nowhere to store it.  I don’t even have a server database to store it.

I'm using Gmail to communicate with people so if you mail to me you email adrress and mail content will be stored on Google infrustructure.

That's all.
